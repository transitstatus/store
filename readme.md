# Store

Store is meant to be a system allowing for large amounts of semi-related to be consolidated into a single API. The original purpose of this API was for me to expand my transit tracking tooling to systems besides Amtrak. However, I realized that this could be used for other things as well, such as weather data.

More documentation is yet to come.
